# Process to create ERD

Steps are

1. **Entity Identification**: If you need to store something about it than it's an entity

2. **Relationship Identification**: Identify the relationships between all entities

3. **Cardinality Identification**: Know the nature of the relationships between the entities

4. **Identify Attributes**: what we want to store about the entities

Now we can create our ERD
